## Linear Regression essentials 

- Simple Linear Regression (one feature):
  - Model: y = β₀ + β₁ x + ε
  - Closed-form fit:
    - β̂₁ = Cov(x, y) / Var(x)
    - β̂₀ = ȳ − β̂₁ x̄
  - Common metrics:
    - MSE = (1/n) Σ (yᵢ − ŷᵢ)²
    - RMSE = √MSE
    - R² = 1 − Σ(y − ŷ)² / Σ(y − ȳ)²

- Multiple Linear Regression (many features):
  - Model: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + … + β_px_p + ε (vector form: y = Xβ + ε)
  - Ordinary Least Squares (if XᵀX invertible): β̂ = (XᵀX)⁻¹ Xᵀ y
  - Practical notes: check multicollinearity, scale features when needed, evaluate with train/test split.

- Polynomial Regression (nonlinear in x, linear in parameters):
  - Model (degree k): y = β₀ + β₁ x + β₂ x² + … + β_k x^k + ε
  - View as linear regression on polynomial features Φ(x) = [1, x, x², …, x^k]
  - OLS on transformed design matrix: β̂ = (ΦᵀΦ)⁻¹ Φᵀ y
  - Practice: generate features via `sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures`, fit with `LinearRegression`; tune degree with cross‑validation to avoid overfitting.

Use scikit-learn for practical training/evaluation:
- SLR/MLR/Poly: `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`, `from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures`
- Split & metrics: `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`, `from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score`

---

## Regularization essentials

Regularization adds a penalty to control model complexity and reduce overfitting.

- Ridge (L2):
  - Objective: min_β (1/2n) ||y − Xβ||² + α ||β||²₂
  - Closed-form: β̂ = (XᵀX + 2nα I)⁻¹ Xᵀ y
  - Properties: shrinks coefficients smoothly; keeps all features; sensitive to feature scale.

- Lasso (L1):
  - Objective: min_β (1/2n) ||y − Xβ||² + α ||β||₁
  - Solution: no closed-form; solved by coordinate descent/ISTA; can set some β_j exactly to 0 (feature selection).

Tips:
- Standardize features first: `StandardScaler()` inside a `Pipeline` with `Ridge`/`Lasso`.
- Tune α via cross-validation: `RidgeCV`, `LassoCV`.

---

## Multicollinearity & VIF essentials

Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated, causing unstable coefficient estimates in linear models.

- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):
  - Formula: VIF_i = 1 / (1 - R²_i), where R²_i is from regressing feature i against all other features
  - Interpretation:
    - VIF = 1: No correlation
    - 1 < VIF < 5: Moderate correlation (acceptable)
    - 5 ≤ VIF < 10: High correlation (concerning)
    - VIF ≥ 10: Very high correlation (action required)

- Detection & Solutions:
  - Calculate VIF: `from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor`
  - Remove features with VIF > 10 iteratively (highest first)
  - Alternative: Use regularization (Ridge/Lasso) which handles multicollinearity naturally
  - Always recalculate VIF after removing features

Practice: Check VIF before finalizing linear regression models; prioritize model interpretability and stability over minor performance gains.

## K-Means Clustering essentials

K-Means is a centroid-based unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters.

- Algorithm Overview:
  - Objective: minimize within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)
  - Formula: J = Σ(i=1 to k) Σ(x∈Ci) ||x - μi||²
  - Steps: Initialize centroids → Assign points → Update centroids → Repeat until convergence

- Key Considerations:
  - **Feature Scaling**: Always scale features (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler) since K-Means uses Euclidean distance
  - **Choosing k**: Use elbow method, silhouette analysis, or domain knowledge
  - **Initialization**: K-Means++ (default in scikit-learn) provides better starting centroids

- Applications:
  - **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers by behavior/demographics
  - **Feature Engineering**: Create cluster-based features, dimensionality reduction
  - **Market Research**: Identify distinct market segments
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Points far from centroids may be outliers

- Implementation:
  - Basic: `from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`
  - Evaluation: `from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score`
  - Preprocessing: Always use `StandardScaler()` or `MinMaxScaler()`

Practice: Scale features first, determine optimal k, validate business relevance of clusters, and use centroids for segment profiling.

## Hierarchical Clustering essentials

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters without requiring a pre-specified number of clusters.

- Algorithm Types:
  - **Agglomerative (Bottom-up)**: Start with individual points, merge closest clusters iteratively
  - **Divisive (Top-down)**: Start with all points, split recursively (less common)

- Linkage Criteria (distance between clusters):
  - **Single**: Minimum distance between any two points
  - **Complete**: Maximum distance between any two points  
  - **Average**: Average distance between all point pairs
  - **Ward**: Minimizes within-cluster variance (most common)

- Key Concepts:
  - **Dendrogram**: Tree diagram showing cluster merging hierarchy
  - **Cutting Height**: Determines final number of clusters
  - **Cophenetic Distance**: Distance at which clusters merge

- Advantages:
  - No need to specify number of clusters beforehand
  - Produces interpretable dendrogram
  - Deterministic results (unlike K-Means)
  - Works well with small datasets

- Implementation:
  - Scikit-learn: `from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering`
  - SciPy: `from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage`
  - Visualization: `dendrogram()` for tree structure analysis

Practice: Use Ward linkage for most cases, analyze dendrogram to choose optimal cluster count, consider computational complexity O(n³) for large datasets.

---

## DBSCAN Clustering essentials

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) finds clusters based on density and automatically identifies outliers.

- Key Parameters:
  - **eps (ε)**: Maximum distance between two samples to be neighbors
  - **min_samples**: Minimum points required to form a dense region (core point)

- Core Concepts:
  - **Core Point**: Has at least min_samples neighbors within eps distance
  - **Border Point**: Within eps of a core point but not core itself
  - **Noise Point**: Neither core nor border (labeled as -1)

- Algorithm Steps:
  1. Identify core points (≥ min_samples neighbors within eps)
  2. Form clusters by connecting core points and their neighbors
  3. Assign border points to nearest cluster
  4. Mark remaining points as noise/outliers

- Key Advantages:
  - **Automatic cluster detection**: No need to specify number of clusters
  - **Arbitrary shapes**: Can find non-spherical clusters
  - **Outlier detection**: Automatically identifies noise points
  - **Robust to outliers**: Outliers don't affect cluster formation

- Parameter Selection:
  - **eps**: Use k-distance plot or domain knowledge
  - **min_samples**: Rule of thumb: 2×dimensions, minimum 3-4
  - **Feature scaling**: Important since DBSCAN uses distance metrics

- Applications:
  - Anomaly detection in fraud/security
  - Image processing and computer vision
  - Geolocation clustering
  - Market segmentation with outlier identification

- Implementation:
  - Basic: `from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN`
  - Preprocessing: Always scale features with `StandardScaler()`
  - Evaluation: Silhouette score (excluding noise points)

Practice: Experiment with eps/min_samples on scaled data, analyze noise points for insights, validate clusters make business sense.

## Classification metrics essentials

Confusion Matrix layout:

|            | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Actual 0   | TN          | FP          |
| Actual 1   | FN          | TP          |

Key formulas (binary):
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- Recall (Sensitivity) = TP / (TP + FN)
- F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)
- Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

When to favor which:
- High Precision: costly false positives (e.g. spam mislabeling important email)
- High Recall: costly false negatives (e.g. disease screening)
- F1: need balance under class imbalance
