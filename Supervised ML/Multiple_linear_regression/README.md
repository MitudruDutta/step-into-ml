# üìñ Multiple Linear Regression: Advanced Home Price Prediction

## Introduction

Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression. It is used to model the relationship between two or more independent variables (features) and a single dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

This project demonstrates how to predict home prices using multiple features‚Äîspecifically, the area and the number of bedrooms.

## üß† Theory

### Key Concepts

The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship between the features and the target. The equation for multiple linear regression is:

**`y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚ÇöX‚Çö + Œµ`**

- **y**: The dependent (target) variable.
- **X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çö**: The independent variables (features).
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ**: The intercept of the model (value of `y` when all features are zero).
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ, ..., Œ≤‚Çö**: The coefficients for each feature. `Œ≤·µ¢` represents the change in `y` for a one-unit change in `X·µ¢`, holding all other features constant.
- **Œµ**: The error term (residuals), representing the difference between the observed and predicted values.

### Matrix Form and The Normal Equation

In practice, especially with many features, the equation is expressed in matrix form:

**`y = XŒ≤ + Œµ`**

- **y**: A vector of observed target values.
- **X**: The design matrix, where each row is an observation and each column is a feature (with an initial column of ones for the intercept `Œ≤‚ÇÄ`).
- **Œ≤**: The vector of coefficients (`Œ≤‚ÇÄ, Œ≤‚ÇÅ, ..., Œ≤‚Çö`).
- **Œµ**: The vector of errors.

The coefficients (Œ≤) are found by minimizing the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**, also known as the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).

**Cost Function (SSE):**
`SSE = Œ£(y·µ¢ - ≈∑·µ¢)¬≤ = (y - XŒ≤)·µÄ(y - XŒ≤)`

The closed-form solution to find the vector of coefficients `Œ≤` that minimizes this cost function is called the **Normal Equation**:

**`Œ≤ = (X·µÄX)‚Åª¬πX·µÄy`**

- **X·µÄ**: The transpose of the design matrix `X`.
- **(X·µÄX)‚Åª¬π**: The inverse of the matrix product `X·µÄX`.

This equation directly calculates the optimal coefficients without requiring an iterative optimization process like gradient descent.

## üìä Dataset

- **File**: `home_prices.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains three columns:
  - `area_sqr_ft`: The area of the house in square feet (Independent Variable).
  - `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house (Independent Variable).
  - `price_lakhs`: The price of the house in Lakhs (Dependent Variable).

## üõ† Implementation Steps

1.  **Load Data**: The `home_prices.csv` dataset is loaded using pandas.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A pair plot and correlation heatmap are used to visualize the relationships between all variables.
3.  **Data Preparation**: The features (`area_sqr_ft`, `bedrooms`) are separated from the target (`price_lakhs`).
4.  **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets to ensure the model can be evaluated on unseen data.
5.  **Model Training**: A `LinearRegression` model from `scikit-learn` is trained using the multiple features in the training set.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed on the test set using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
7.  **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict the price of a new house given its area and number of bedrooms.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Strengths**: Allows for modeling more complex relationships by incorporating multiple factors. Still highly interpretable.
- **Limitations**: Assumes a linear relationship between each feature and the target. It can be affected by **multicollinearity** (high correlation between independent variables).
- **Use Cases**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and age; estimating a student's exam score based on study hours and previous grades.
